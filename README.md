# Client-Server-Database
This project was developed as part of Systems Programming (CS 3377) at UT Dallas. It implements a lightweight client-server database using C, TCP/IP sockets, and multi-threading.

Features

Client-Server Communication: Built with TCP sockets for reliable request/response handling.

Multi-Threaded Server: Uses pthreads to handle multiple clients concurrently.

Custom Message Protocol: Structured request types (PUT/GET) for adding and retrieving records.

Persistent Storage: Stores records in a binary file to simulate a simple database.

Error Handling: Includes safeguards for incomplete messages, invalid input, and dropped connections.

Skills Demonstrated

Systems-level programming in C

Socket programming and network protocols

Concurrency and multi-threading

File I/O and lightweight database design
